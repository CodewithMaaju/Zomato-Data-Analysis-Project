# Zomato Data Analysis Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a **data analysis and visualization** of Zomato, a leading food delivery platform operating across multiple countries. The goal was to extract valuable insights from raw data using **Python** and key data analysis libraries.

## 🔍 Objectives
- Clean and preprocess raw data for analysis.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand customer ratings, sales trends (online vs. offline), and restaurant performance.
- Visualize key insights using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for better interpretation.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Libraries Used
- **Python** (Data Analysis & Computation)
- **NumPy** (Numerical computations)
- **Pandas** (Data manipulation & preprocessing)
- **Matplotlib** (Data visualization)
- **Seaborn** (Advanced statistical plots)

## 📊 Key Insights Extracted
- **Sales Analysis**: Comparison of **online vs. offline** sales.
- **Customer Ratings**: Understanding customer grading patterns based on restaurant services.
- **Geographical Insights**: Identifying country-wise variations in ratings and sales.
- **Data Cleaning & Transformation**: Handling missing values, duplicates, and data inconsistencies.

## 📷 Visualizations & Insights
The project includes:
- Box plots, count plots, and heatmaps for **rating distributions**.
- Bar charts for **online vs. offline sales comparison**.
- Scatter plots to analyze **restaurant performance and customer preferences**.
